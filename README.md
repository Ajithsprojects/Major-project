DETECTION OF THYROID DISORDER USING
MACHINELEARNING APPROACH

# ABSTRTACT
The disease like Thyroid is found in 42 million people in India. The Thyroid gland is a
vascular gland and one of the most important organs of a human body. This gland secretes
two hormones which help in controlling the metabolism of the body. The two types of
Thyroid disorders are Hyperthyroidism and Hypothyroidism. When this disorder occurs in
the body, they release certain type of hormones into the body which imbalances the bodyâ€™s
metabolism. This project is designed to detect the thyroid disease in humans by using
Machine learning. A User Interface is created to import the dataset. The model, which is
designed to detect the thyroid disease, uses for three different machine learning algorithms.
The machine learning algorithms used to detect thyroid disease, in this project are SVM,
Random Forest and Naive bayes. Accuracy of the model, using different machine learning
algorithms is depicted. Among those different machine learning algorithms used, the model
which gives best accuracy is chosen as the best machine learning algorithm for detecting
thyroid disease.
